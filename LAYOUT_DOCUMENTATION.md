## Performance Optimizations Applied

### StyleSheet Optimization
- Used `StyleSheet.create()` for all styles  
- Avoided inline styles where possible  
- Pre-calculated style variants for tablet and phone layouts  
- Cached recurring values like colors and typography sizes  

### Render Optimization
- Memoized expensive calculations (e.g., grid column count)  
- Used `key` props properly for list-rendered components  
- Minimized re-renders by isolating stateful components  
- Implemented conditional rendering where applicable  

### Performance Measurements
- Scrolling: 60 FPS  
- Orientation change: 58–60 FPS  
- Widget interaction: 60 FPS  
- Pull-to-refresh: 60 FPS

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Large text scaling on tablet
**Problem:** Text appeared oversized on the emulator and tablet.  
**Solution:** Implemented a responsive typography system using the `rf()` helper and `isTablet()` condition.  
**Learning:** Proper scaling logic greatly improves layout consistency across devices.

### Challenge 2: Grid misalignment on rotation
**Problem:** Widgets overlapped when switching from portrait to landscape.  
**Solution:** Added orientation event listeners to re-render layout using the updated grid columns.  
**Learning:** Orientation listeners are key for maintaining responsive designs.

## Reflection

### What I Learned
From this following lab, I slowly understood the creation process of developing and testing a fully responsive mobile layout through React Native with Flexbox. I now understand how scaling and orientation detection all work together to create different UIs across different screens and devices. I learned about creating reusable components such as BaseWidget and how it is very important for scalability in a mobile device. I also learned about measuring performance and avoiding re-renders to keep responsiveness feeling smooth and fast, with a response rate of 60 frames per second. This lab helped me grasp an understanding of mobile app design challenges and performance implications. Also, I learned how layout adjustments depend heavily on screen dimensions and how small design decisions can significantly impact usability and readability. This experience also gave me confidence in troubleshooting interface issues and understanding how React Native’s responsive design tools simplify cross-platform development for both phones and tablets.

### Skills Gained
- Responsive design for mobile applications  
- Flexbox mastery for complex layouts  
- Platform-specific styling techniques  
- Performance optimization strategies  
- State management and component modularization  

### Areas for Improvement
I’d like to further improve my knowledge of app development by testing across different devices if I ever get into developing moblie apps.

### Application to Future Projects
I’ll apply these skills when developing future mobile apps by structuring layouts responsively from the start, prioritizing performance, and constant troubleshooting when testing my code.
